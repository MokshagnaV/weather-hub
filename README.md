# Weather Hub

Weather Hub is a weather app, which shows weather of client's current location (if they enable location permission on their browser). User can also search for a specific location and displays weather. The background image is also displaying according to the weather condition.

### APIs used

For retrieving weather information, I have used [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and for generating background pictures according to the current weather i have used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
